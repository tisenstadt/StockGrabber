Welcome to StockGrabber!

This Ruby script takes in a JSON file of company symbols and retrieves the corresponding stock prices as a CSV.
To use this script, clone the repository with Ruby installed, and navigate to the directory where you have saved the files. Run the "script" file with Ruby and a CSV will be saved to this directory.
Minitest is required to run the test file.
